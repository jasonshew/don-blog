I tried my best to do this in four schools: once as vice principal and three times as principal.  I’m glad I knew these basic principles before coming into the role:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Status quo is a powerful force.</li>\n<li>People do what’s best for them.</li>\n<li>Collaboration works better than  clobberation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a newcomer to the school, I knew it was better and smarter at first to watch and listen before starting to make changes based on initial observations and assumptions.  Sometimes a practice that looks ineffective is in place for a very good reason. Sometimes, though, a resistance to change is none other than a reluctance to take initiative, learn new skills and put in the work.</p>\n<p>Different leaders have different styles that reflect the way they interact with others. I am  collaborative.  Before I make a decision of consequence, I instinctively reach out strategically to others and draw upon their knowledge and experience. It was natural, therefore, to do this as an administrator.</p>\n<p>My leadership motto is “collaboration is multiplication”. Consulting and brainstorming with those impacted leads to wiser, more fulsome decisions, more collective support and the kind of change powerful enough to break through the status quo for the ultimate good of the learners.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "I came into the administrative role with high expectations.  I expected a perfect opportunity to empower staff, support students and engage the community.  I tried my best to do this in four schools: once as vice principal and three times as principal.  I’m glad I knew these basic principles before coming into the role:\n1. Status quo is a powerful force. \n2. People do what’s best for them.\n3. Collaboration works better than  clobberation. \n\nAs a newcomer to the school, I knew it was better and smarter at first to watch and listen before starting to make changes based on initial observations and assumptions.  Sometimes a practice that looks ineffective is in place for a very good reason. Sometimes, though, a resistance to change is none other than a reluctance to take initiative, learn new skills and put in the work. \n\nDifferent leaders have different styles that reflect the way they interact with others. I am  collaborative.  Before I make a decision of consequence, I instinctively reach out strategically to others and draw upon their knowledge and experience. It was natural, therefore, to do this as an administrator. \n\nMy leadership motto is “collaboration is multiplication”. Consulting and brainstorming with those impacted leads to wiser, more fulsome decisions, more collective support and the kind of change powerful enough to break through the status quo for the ultimate good of the learners. \n\n\n",

Three of my siblings had already left to study and their experiences seemed only positive from my perspective.  On the other hand, I was anxious (understatement) to leave home with so many what-ifs clouding my future. I settled on a university which had a satellite college in my home town, citing the offer of a full scholarship as my reason, but honestly I was just not ready to leave  home where things were predictable and safe.  \n\nThe college experience was a new element in my life at least and the different setting with higher expectations and new people to navigate, significantly pushed back the boundaries of my comfort zone. The pride I felt in my academic successes in that first year, however, was tempered by the voice in my head telling me that I had settled for less and that I needed to leave home and actually launch.  I was ready … in an act-as-if sort of mind set. \n",
