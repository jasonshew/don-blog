			 <p>I was a classic bully magnet: shy, uncertain and a tad inept.  Soft spoken, conflict avoiding and nerdy.  On my way home from school one day, a couple dogs from opposite sides of the street teamed up and joyfully bark-chased me till they lost interest. Even animals knew a victim when they spotted one.  Every school has its collection of thugs who find their fun in teasing and torment. Mine was typical. The memories of what actually was said or happened have faded, but the smug faces of my tormentors are easily recalled all these years later.  My early school years were not much fun.  High school changed all that.</p>

			 <p>Gradually, I recognized what most already knew: if you want to do better at school, pay attention and do your work. It wasn‚Äôt and still isn‚Äôt rocket science, but it was a while before this guy made the connection.  I got better at the school way of learning and started to enjoy a slow ascent from the bottom of the grading ladder. Getting good grades and accolades became a way of boosting self-esteem in a context where I felt underestimated and discounted.  Things were looking up.  Then came the bullies.</p>

			 <p>I had the usual gamut of occupations in mind as a kid: firefighter, police officer, veterinarian and the like. It wasn‚Äôt until I had my first male teacher in grade 5 that I thought that maybe this would be something I would like to do. I don‚Äôt think that I ever considered any other career very seriously after that. I didn‚Äôt do particularly well in school at first so I‚Äôm not sure why I thought teaching would be an appropriate option.  In fact, one teacher spoke with my parents about holding me back so I could experience the joys of grade 3 once again.  It didn‚Äôt happen and I moved on minus the extra joy. ‚ÄúRecommended‚Äù was the word used which basically was a wait and see until Christmas.  Something must have clicked because Christmas came and went without the hook pulling me back a grade.  I wasn‚Äôt setting the world on fire, but at least the movement was forward.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I tried acting starting with roles in kids‚Äô musicals and then moved on to more serious productions geared towards adult audiences. It became obvious that blanking out, forgetting lines and ad-libbing were deal breakers. Unfortunately, practice doesn‚Äôt always make perfect. Besides, type-casting me as a snooty, self-important blowhard more than once was kind of humbling.  My experience on stage, however, gave me a huge appreciation for those who do it well and today I remain an avid theatre-goer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As a kid, I was the kind every old lady adored. I was quiet, polite and could sit for hours without reprimand in the company of adults. Truth be told, I was coddled and shy.  Being silent shielded me from notice and possible embarrassment.  It‚Äôs ironic how my abilities often gave me a spotlight.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my teachers suggested I get into public speaking because I would be good at it. I thought that this was some sort of take-on-a-project-student effort on her part, and dismissed it. But eventually, even I had to admit when we gave speeches in schools, mine were actually pretty good.  During my career, I had many opportunities to stand up in front of audiences and make comments and give formal talks. At my retirement party, a member of my staff commented that one of the things about me that had always impressed her was my ability to give a speech at a moment‚Äôs notice on any topic under the sun. The shy little guy who still dwells within loves that.</p>

			 <p>I sang my first solo at a Christmas concert when I was in grade 9: the wise man who brought toddler Jesus the gold.  Turns out this boy could sing and sing I did ‚Ä¶. weddings, funerals, concerts and festivals. I sang for years and gradually realized that when people said I was great, it was true. üò≥</p>

			 <p>What a great idea to join the community choir: new friends with a passion for singing and lots of  concerts to fundraise for community projects and needy folks.  We are a grey-headed bunch to be sure with lots of life experience, a mix of good and bad times and the wisdom that tags along with it.</p>

			 <p>Doing the same job you retired from is like eating leftovers. Tasty at first, but then predictably bland.  New path: find some fun and maybe fulfilment doing enjoyable things.  Joined a community choir, watched cheap Tuesday movies, walked trails by the river and got very busy.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A call from my former employer gave me a short term reprieve from my transition in the form of a series of short-term contracts basically doing what I had pre-retirement, but with reduced  expectations and less accountability. Filling their gap also served to fill mine. Temporarily at least.</p>

			 <p>I remember my first post retirement project: binging Netflix‚Äôs Lost series ‚Ä¶. 6 seasons and 121 episodes.  Didn‚Äôt understand the ending, but a finish nonetheless. A series of unspectacular time-fillers followed showcased on social media with posts featuring cupcakes, treadmills, and balcony views.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôm not saying a chance to reset and repurpose isn‚Äôt a good thing.  For me, the transition was unexpectedly difficult. My work identity had mascaraded as real self and prioritized its needs for years. After the parties and well wishes, freedom‚Äôs glow lasted about two weeks.</p>

			 <p>Two words that I never thought would fit together: retirement and sucks.  But it did.  Some days, while I was working, thinking about retirement helped me hang onto sanity.  Hang in there, I told myself.  One day my time will be my own ‚Ä¶ completely.  Be careful what you wish for.</p>
